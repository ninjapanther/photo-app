To setup homepage, generate a controller with an action:

Then set the root route to this in the config/routes.rb file by uncommenting the root 'welcome#index' line

Test it out in the preview

You can update the page as you need, you can find this index view in the app/views/welcome folder in a file called index.html.erb

Initialize a git repo for the app and make a commit

Prepare the app for deployment to heroku by moving the sqlite3 gem to group development and then creating a group production and adding the gems necessary below it:

group :production do

gem 'pg'

gem 'rails_12factor'

end

Then run:

bundle install --without production

Create a github repository in your github account for this app, follow steps to setup remote for this repo from your app

Make a commit of your code and push to your github repo

Create a heroku app by using heroku create

Rename the app to something you like by using heroku rename nameofyourchoice

Ensure your latest changes are committed using git status, if not, make a commit

To deploy your app to production:

git push heroku master

Then test out the URL to view your app in production
